# Object-Localization-and-Extraction-with-Bounding-Boxes
This project focuses on localizing a specified object within an image, enclosing it with a bounding box, and extracting the object by removing the surrounding background, leaving only the object with a transparent background. The project uses only NumPy and OpenCV libraries for image processing tasks.
